  ## Description
    Using tools like PSQL and applicaitons like Insomnia we tested routes using a configured api location. Using routes within our seeds and routes we were able to look up specific items based on tag, category, and the actual product themselves. When entering the right path on Insomnia we are able to generate that specific piece of information. WE were instructed to generate all the information for each type as well as a specific item within each array. We were then supposed to update one fo the types and delete a type of information while in Insomnia.
